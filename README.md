# Zomato Clone

This is a visual replica of the Zomato website, created to match its design aesthetics without implementing functionality or responsiveness.

## Features

- **UI Similarity:** The layout, colors, fonts, and general design closely resemble Zomato's interface.
- **Homepage:** Includes banner images, search bar, and featured restaurants section similar to Zomato.
- **Navigation Bar:** Mimics Zomato's menu structure with login/signup options.
- **Restaurant Cards:** Designed to look like Zomato’s restaurant listings with images, ratings, and brief descriptions.
- **Footer:** Replicates Zomato's footer, including links to different sections.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For structuring the pages
- **CSS** – For styling and achieving design similarity

## Limitations

- **No Backend:** This project is purely front-end and does not include any functional features.
- **Non-Responsive:** The design is not optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Static Content:** No dynamic restaurant listings, user interactions, or API integrations.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FarisShamsudeen/Zomato-Clone
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the cloned design.


## Future Improvements (Not Surely)

- Implement responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Add interactivity using JavaScript
- Introduce backend functionality to make it a fully functional Zomato clone
